## Overview
In this project, we empirically assess the effects of modifying a dataset through anonymization and cleaning on the output of several model-agnostic interpretability techniques including: permutation, partial dependence, global surrogates, and Friedmanâ€™s H-Statistic for feature interaction.

A report describing our work can be found in a jupyter notebook in the folder "ac221_final_project_submission".
